# Python Keylogging to Telegram

This is a Python script that logs all the keystrokes from a keyboard and sends the data to a Telegram bot. This script can be useful for monitoring the activities of a computer or for debugging purposes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ankit-pn/python-keylogging-to-telegram
```


2. Install the required Python packages:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a new Telegram bot and get the bot token.
4. Create a new Telegram channel or group and add your bot to it.
5. Get the channel or group ID. You can do this by sending a message to the channel or group and then visiting the following URL:

```sh
https://api.telegram.org/bot<your-bot-token>/getUpdates
```

6. Edit config.json file with your bot_token and chat_id. You can also set time after which you recieve the message

```json
{
    "bot_token": "YOUR ACCESS ID",
    "chat_id": "YOUR CHAT ID",
    "timer": 30
}
```

## Usage

1. Activate your virtual environment (if you are using one).

2. Run the script:
```sh
python3 keylogger.py
```
3. Press any key on the keyboard.
